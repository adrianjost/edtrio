# Sorting Task Plugin

## 1. Use case
Give teachers the ability to create questions and answers. The students then decide whether they can explain the question or not.
At the end, students can discuss those questions with each other.

Sorting tasks are a didactic concept in which students can acquire knowledge iteratively. The teacher provides the pupils with index cards with keywords to be explained, which they then sort into two stacks. "I can explain" and "I can't explain yet". 

In the following iterations the students get together and try to understand their not yet known terms and to acquire new knowledge.

## 2. Technologies
React Components are extended with Typescript Interfaces for type safety similar to [React PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)

## 3. Architecture
The plugin uses several components as shown below and is treated as a [void](https://docs.slatejs.org/slate-core/schema#isvoid) node by Slate.js.
This means the plugin needs to handle events like click and edit itself. Additionally the state must be persisted into the global Editor State.

```text
├── SortingTaskNode
│   └── LearningItems
        └── LearningItem
│   └── EditView
│   └── ReadView
│       └── FlipCard
│       └── ResultCard
```
The `LearningItems` and `EditView` components are only visible for the teacher. The `ReadView` component for the student.
The `SortingTaskNode` component decides which of those components to render
```jsx
public render() {
    return (
        ...
        { readOnly
        ? <ReadView learningItems={this.state.learningItems} />
        : <EditView learningItems={this.state.learningItems} onEdit={this.editHandler()} />
        }
        ...
    );
}
```
