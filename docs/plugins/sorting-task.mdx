# Sorting Task Plugin

## 1. Use case
Give teachers the ability to create questions and answers. The students then decide whether they can explain the question or not.
At the end, students can discuss those questions with each other.

## 2. Technologies
React Components are extended with Typescript Interfaces for type safety similar to [React PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)

## 3. Architecture
The plugin uses several components as shown below and is treated as a [void](https://docs.slatejs.org/slate-core/schema#isvoid) node by Slate.js.
This means the plugin needs to handle events like click and edit itself. Additionally the state must be persisted into the global Editor State.

```text
├── SortingTaskNode
│   └── LearningItems
        └── LearningItem
│   └── EditView
│   └── ReadView
│       └── FlipCard
│       └── ResultCard
```
The `LearningItems` and `EditView` components are only visible for the teacher. The `ReadView` component for the student.
The `SortingTaskNode` component decides which of those components to render
```jsx
public render() {
    return (
        ...
        { readOnly
        ? <ReadView learningItems={this.state.learningItems} />
        : <EditView learningItems={this.state.learningItems} onEdit={this.editHandler()} />
        }
        ...
    );
}
```
